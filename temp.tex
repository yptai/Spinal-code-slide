We implement a fixed-rate Spinal code [1]. The core idea of the encoder is the sequential application of a hash
function which has two inputs:a $v$-bit state $v_{i-1}$ and a $k$ bits message $\overline{c}_i$
. The output of the hash function is a
new $v$-bits state $s_i$:
\begin{equation}
s_i=h(s_{i-1},\overline{c}_i),s_0=0^v
\end{equation}
Each State $s_i$ is called a spine and it is used to seed a random number generator (RNG) to generate a sequence of
$L$ pseudo-random $q$-bit numbers. Finally, the $q$ bits of each pseudo random number are mapped to symbols $x_i$ chosen from a given constellation and sent
. When Spinal codes have a fixed code rate, it is given by $R=k/(L\cdot q)$
